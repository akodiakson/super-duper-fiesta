# Three Hive

A fast-paced number game where you race the clock to find every number divisible by three on a board of triangles.

## The Backstory

This game is inspired by a trick my 7th grade algebra teacher "Ms. B" taught me for determining if any number is divisible by three. The rule is simple: if you add the digits of a number together and the sum is divisible by three, so is the original number.

For example, 54 (5 + 4 = 9), 723 (7 + 2 + 3 = 12), and 174,492 (1 + 7 + 4 + 4 + 9 + 2 = 27) are all divisible by three. Some numbers make it obvious — like 369, 36, or 3 — but the digit-sum trick works for any number, no matter how large.

That hack stuck with me. To this day, I find myself doing the math on any number I see — odometers, house addresses, the time on a clock. Three Hive turns that habit into a game.

## How to Play

1. Choose a difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and a triangle count (9, 18, or 27)
2. When the countdown ends, tap every triangle whose number is divisible by 3
3. Find them all before time runs out for a perfect score
4. Build streaks for combo bonuses and earn time-remaining points for speed
